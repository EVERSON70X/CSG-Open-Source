Geometry Rationale: Icosahedral Core with Spherical Shield

This design intentionally combines an icosahedral internal neutronics structure with a spherical external shield to optimize both reactor performance and experimental flexibility.
Core Geometry (Neutronics Optimization)

    The internal structure uses a truncated icosahedral arrangement (32 discrete fusion source regions with structured breeder geometry).

    This configuration produces a highly structured neutron field, which has been shown through OpenMC simulations to:

        Significantly increase Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR)

        Enable favorable enrichment behavior (e.g., Li-6 ~50% outperforming higher enrichments)

    The structured angular flux distribution is preserved within the breeder region and is central to the system’s neutronics performance.

Spherical External Shield (Engineering Simplicity)

    The outer shield is purely spherical, independent of the internal icosahedral structure.

    Benefits of a spherical shield include:

        Radially symmetric attenuation that is straightforward to analyze and engineer

        Clean definition of detector or diagnostic radii

        Simplified thermal, structural, and shielding calculations

    The breeder region is fully contained well inside the shield radius.

Diagnostic & Physics Ports (Optional Overlay)

    A small number of diagnostic / physics experiment ports may be placed in the outer shield at a radius outside the tritium breeding region.

    These ports:

        Do not intersect the breeder

        Do not alter the tritium-producing lithium inventory

        Only affect neutron and gamma behavior after breeding has already occurred

As a result, global TBR is expected to be unaffected within Monte Carlo uncertainty.

From a neutronics standpoint, these ports perturb:

    Local leakage

    External dose fields

    Detector backgrounds

…but not the neutron balance that determines TBR.
Validation Philosophy

For completeness and reviewer-proof documentation, a representative validation step is planned:

    Run OpenMC cases comparing:

        Baseline icosahedral core + spherical shield

        Same geometry with a representative detector port in the shield

    Compare total TBR between cases

Expected outcome:

    ΔTBR within statistical uncertainty or at worst sub-percent

    Allows the following statement to be made explicitly:

    “Diagnostic ports and detector penetrations are located entirely outside the tritium breeding region and have negligible impact on global Tritium Breeding Ratio.”

Why This Matters

    Commercial mission remains clean: power generation, tritium self-sufficiency, and systems engineering come first.

    Research flexibility is preserved: the structured neutron field enables optional experiments (e.g., rare-event detection, axion or dark-sector studies) without compromising reactor performance.

    The architecture cleanly separates core function from instrumentation, which is ideal for both patents and open-source collaboration.
